## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Selectors
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries
- Imported Font
- Relative and absolute sizes

### What I learned

What I learned was how to import a downloaded font and use it in the design, also how to use HSL for color and that shadows can give that more aesthetic touch.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about HSL and master it because it is a more efficient way to use colors,

### Useful resources

- [Load and Use Fonts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css) - This resource helped me to remember the ways to use fonts in css, including importing them from downloaded files, the article is very interesting and practical.
